# Long_Context_Paper

Both jupyter notebooks show the scripts that were used to generate the literature reviews for camparison.

In the Literature Reviews file we have shared all the literature reviews that were generated using long context and short context window of LLMs. Version 'a' for literature reviews was generated from long context window and version 'b' was generated from short context window.
